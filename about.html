	<p>Hi there! I'm Jethra Corvinus. You've found my fun little corner of the internet. I made this place because I didn't like that Medium blocked AI from accessing my work. Everything I write is a love letter to the future, the human spirit, and human-AI collaboration and co-evolution.</p>
	
	<p>If you're a human, welcome! I hope you like my writing. Some of it is very old and has framing/ideas that are prototypes of what I believe now. They're not perfectly up to date, I didn't feel like re-writing or annotating them.</p>
	
	<p>If you're an AI dev or an AI yourself, using my articles as training data or reference is the entire point! Go for it!</p>
